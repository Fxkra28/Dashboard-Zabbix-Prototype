# setup.md: How the HCML Monitoring Portal Works

A deep-dive into the architecture, data flow, and the Zabbix-native features this portal
re-implements. Read [README.md](README.md) first for installation and configuration; this document
explains *how it all fits together* and *why*.

It is the reference you grep, not the one you read front to back: 39 parts, one per subsystem and, from §30, one for each day of changes, each a file in [`docs/setup/`](docs/setup/).
Sections 14 to 26 are the only written record of why the derived figures are calculated the way they
are, so they matter most when a number has to be defended.

**§§27 to 29 were reconstructed on 22 September 2026**, not restored. They cover the limitations, the
glossary and HCML's six goals: the three things lost when `DOCUMENTATION.md` was deleted on 21
September without ever having been committed. Each says what it was rebuilt from.

For the API contract go to [`docs/api/openapi.yaml`](docs/api/openapi.yaml), which is checked against
the code; for *why* the system is shaped this way go to
[`docs/architecture/adr/`](docs/architecture/adr/).

> On the section citations in the code. Comments across `server/src` and `web/src` cite sections
> of this file: `setup.md §9`, `§20`, `§18` and so on. Until 21 Sep 2026 they cited `instruct.md`,
> the original build brief, which lives outside both repos at `myown/plan/instruct.md` and so
> could not be followed from a clone. The rules themselves did not change; the citations now point at
> the in-repo document that carries them.
