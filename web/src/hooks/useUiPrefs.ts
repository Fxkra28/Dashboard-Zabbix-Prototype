/**
 * Two pieces of chrome state that outlive a page load: which theme the viewer picked, and whether

 * views, and it needs neither a backend change nor a state library (DESIGN.md section 6).
 *
 * Every access is guarded: Safari in private mode throws on setItem rather than returning, and a
 * portal that cannot render because it could not save a sidebar width is worse than a sidebar that
