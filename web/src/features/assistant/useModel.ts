 * Whether the AI model is known not to answer, from the `ready.model` a signed-in /api/health

 * opens rather than once per session: the shared capabilities call runs before sign-in and never
 * holds it, and a model can stop or start at any hour. Only `down` counts. `ok`, `off`,
 * `not_checked` (the hosted model, which a probe would bill), a BFF that predates the field and a
 * failed call all read as "no notice".
