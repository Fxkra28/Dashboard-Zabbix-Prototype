/**
 * The light theme's values, duplicated here only as fallbacks for the canvas.
 *
 * styles.css is the source of truth: everything that can read a CSS custom
 * property does, which is what lets the dark theme exist. ECharts paints to a
 * canvas and cannot resolve `var()`, so TimeSeriesChart reads the tokens at
 * render and falls back to these if it runs without a document.
 *
 * Keep them equal to the `:root` block. A value that drifts is only ever seen
 * during server-side rendering, which makes it the kind of difference nobody
 * notices until it is load-bearing.
