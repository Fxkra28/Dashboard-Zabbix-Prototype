/**
 * The contract with the BFF as a page sees it: `api`, one method for each endpoint a page reads, and the few functions beside it (sign-in,
 * the live stream, the Assistant's chat, the report file names). Each part of the portal has its calls in a file of its own here, the
 * transport and its deadlines are in `client.ts` and the session is in `session.ts`; this file puts the calls into the one object the pages
 * use, so a page, and a test that replaces `api`, import from `../api` and need not know which file holds a call.
 *
 * `session.ts` does not import this file or the calls: it holds the session and sign-in, and everything else may use it.
