The portal's two typefaces, served from this site (ayoyo_1.1 IN-22). Before this, every page load fetched
them from fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com, a third party on each visit to a confidential portal.

Inter                 variable, one file per subset, covers weights 400 to 700
IBM Plex Mono         static, weights 400, 500 and 600

Both are licensed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1, copied beside this file (OFL-Inter.txt and
OFL-IBM-Plex.txt). That licence lets them be served with an application, and asks that it travel with them.

Where they came from: the files Google Fonts serves for the stylesheet this page used to load,
  https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=IBM+Plex+Mono:wght@400;500;600&family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700
taken on 12 October 2026, over HTTPS, WOFF2 signature checked. Only the "latin" and "latin-ext" subsets are kept,
which cover English, Indonesian and most European names. Text in another script (Cyrillic, Greek, Vietnamese)
falls back to the system font, as the stylesheet's font stacks say.

To change one, replace the file, keep the name, and update the @font-face rule in src/styles.css if the range or
weights changed. nginx caches /fonts/ for 30 days, not for ever, because the names are not content-hashed.
