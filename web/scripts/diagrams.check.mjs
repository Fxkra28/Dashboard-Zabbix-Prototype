/**
 * Every diagram source still matches the render that sits beside it.
 *
 * The PDFs and PNGs under docs/ are committed renders of the `.mmd` files next to them, and nothing
 * else ties a picture to its source. When this was added, nine renders in one copy and eight in the
 * other were older than their sources by file date, and the picture a reader opens said nothing about
 * it. A file date cannot settle this: a git checkout gives every file the time of the checkout. So each
 * source ends with a stamp, `%% source-hash: <12 hex>`, the SHA-256 of the source without that line,
 * and this fails when the two differ: the source was edited after the stamp was set.
 *
 * What it proves: the source has not changed since `diagrams.stamp.mjs` last ran, every source has a
 * PDF beside it, and no render is left without its source. What it cannot prove: that the render was
 * made after the edit. The stamp is the person's word that it was, which is why stamping is a separate
 * step, run last, after the re-render (the invocations are in docs/contributing.md).
 *
 *   node web/scripts/diagrams.check.mjs [repo root]   (default: two levels up)
 *
 * Read-only. The stamping script is the one that writes.
