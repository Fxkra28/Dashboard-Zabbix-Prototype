## One host state, ping first

`server/src/domain/reachability.ts` decides one state per host for Sites, Hosts, Network and the assistant:
`up`, `down`, `degraded`, `nodata` or `disabled`, with a `reason`.

| Situation | State | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Host disabled in Zabbix | `disabled` | `disabled` |
| Fresh ping answered, but the SNMP / agent interface is failing | `degraded` | `snmp-silent` / `agent-silent` |
| Fresh ping answered | `up` | `ping` |
| Fresh ping failed | `down` | `ping` |
| No fresh ping: the interface flags decide | `up` / `down` | `interface` |
| Nothing to go on | `nodata` | `stale`, `no-interface` or `unsupported` |

A ping value is fresh when the item is supported, has collected, and is no older than
`max(3 × delay, 10 min)`. Before, availability came from interface flags alone: 16 of the 23 hosts
shown "unavailable" were answering ping (FortiGates whose SNMP went silent), and 43 hosts with no
interface were "unknown". `/api/sites` and `/api/hosts/overview` add `state` and `reason` (the old
`availability` field stays); sites add `up` / `down` / `degraded` / `nodata` counts and are ordered
by open severity, then hosts down. The Links page applies the same freshness rule.

## Is Zabbix still collecting?

A stopped `zabbix-server` leaves every API call working and every value in place, so a frozen
estate looks live. `GET /api/freshness` rolls up the newest `lastclock` of any supported ICMP item,
from the same `item.get` the host states read (so it costs Zabbix no extra call), and says `stale`
once nothing has been collected for ten minutes, the same floor a ping stays fresh for. The
Dashboard polls it every minute: when stale it shows "Zabbix has collected nothing since …" and
turns the Live badge to the late style. No ICMP item means an unknown age, never a stale one.

## Never-measured hosts

`/api/sli` marks a host `measured: false` when none of its ICMP items has ever collected: 45 hosts
in August (42 with no interface in Zabbix, so the ping check cannot run; 3 disabled). HCML's report
method counts each as 100 %; the SLA page lists them and the figures are unchanged
(`scripts/validate-sli.ts` still matches Jun to Aug exactly).

## Reports

- `trend.get` is read in slices of at most ~26,000 rows (items × hours), so 365-day availability
  and capacity reports answer (they returned 502 when Zabbix's frontend ran out of memory).
- `basis=all-problems` honours `month` (a bad, future or >400-day-old month is a 400).
- `/api/reports/noise?top=N` (default 100, max 1,000) returns the top rows and `total`.

## Caching

`cached(key, ttl, fn, { staleMs, staleIfError, pin })` in `cache.ts`:
- at most 500 entries and about 64 MB of values (estimated by `approxBytes`), least recently used
  evicted first. A value bigger than the whole budget is answered but not stored, with a warning;
- `pin`: evicted only after every unpinned entry, so a run of graph keys cannot push out a closed
  month's SLA report (`services/sli.ts` pins closed months). Pins share at most 32 MB;
- `staleMs`: serve the previous value while one background refresh runs, only for the slow reports
  (`derived-sli:*`, `avail:*`, `noise:*`, `capacity:*`), never for anything carrying problem state;
- `staleIfError`: if Zabbix fails, answer from the last good run rather than a 502. The request is
  told: `staleness.ts` adds `X-Data-Stale: true` and `X-Data-Age-Seconds` to that answer, from a
  note `cache.ts` leaves in a request-scoped store, and to no other. The web app shows "Zabbix did
  not answer, so this is the last copy the portal kept, from …" on the SLA, Availability, Capacity
  and Alert noise pages;
- `invalidate(prefix, { holdMs })` also cancels fetches already in flight, so data from before an
  acknowledge is never stored again; after a write, matching keys are held at a ≤ 2 s TTL for 15 s.

## Bandwidth

- JSON over 1 KB is compressed (`compress.ts`): brotli quality 4 or gzip level 6:
  `/api/problems` 459 KB → 25 KB in ~3 ms.
- The live stream (`/api/stream`) runs one shared ticker, sends the problem list when something shown
  changes, never resends an identical one, and respects back-pressure. Its frames carry only the
  fields the Dashboard reads, and go gzipped to a screen that accepts it (166,741 bytes become 18,693
  on HCML's list, §7).
- The web app polls one request at a time, aborts requests nobody needs any more, pauses in hidden
  tabs, dims stale data while new parameters load, and keeps the page when a refresh fails.
- nginx gzips the app's own files over 1 KB; `/bff` is left to `compress.ts`.

## Logs and ports

- No URL carries a token since the session cookie (ADR-0010). A page loaded before that change still
  puts `?token=` on its stream URL until it reloads, so the BFF log still redacts it from request
  URLs, and nginx's access log writes `token=redacted` in its place. nginx's error log records the
  full request line, such a token included, for example while the BFF is down.
- nginx appends the address it sees to `X-Forwarded-For`, and the BFF trusts that one hop, so a
  client cannot choose its own rate-limit key. The sign-in limit is keyed on username and address,
  because behind Docker's port publishing every browser arrives from the same gateway address.
- The live stream has its own nginx location whose error log is set to `crit`, so an unreachable BFF
  does not write an old page's stream token into the error log.
- Docker publishes the Zabbix UI (8080) and the portals (8081, and 8082 for the Ollama variant) on
  `127.0.0.1` only; the trapper port 10051 is no longer published.

## Guards against drift

- `web/scripts/css.check.mjs` fails on an unclosed block, a stray `}` or a declaration outside a rule
  (a lost brace once left ~50 rules silently unapplied; Vite does not catch it).
- `tools/check/diagrams.check.mjs` fails when a diagram source was edited after its stamp, the
  `%% source-hash:` line that ends each `.mmd`. A file date cannot say whether a render is old, because a
  git checkout resets it; `tools/check/diagrams.stamp.mjs` sets the stamp, after the re-render.
- The two portals no longer drift by construction: since 18 September they hold the same source tree,
  so `diff -r` over `server/src`, `server/scripts`, `web/src` and `web/scripts` must print nothing.
  That replaced `scripts/check-sync.mjs` and its list of allowed differences, which had nothing left
  to allow.
- `server/src/export/` keeps three copies of things the web app owns, because the BFF cannot import
  the browser bundle or `web/public`: the light-theme colours (`theme.ts`), the HCML logo (`logo.ts`)
  and the SLA page's method note and banner, word for word, with a handful of its other phrases
  (`slaReport.ts`). `export-theme.test.ts`, `export-pdf.test.ts` and `export-sla-report.test.ts` read
  the originals and fail when a copy drifts.

## Assistant speed (local model)

- Reused snapshot. The snapshot is kept for up to 5 minutes and rebuilt at once when a problem
  opens, closes, is acknowledged or re-graded, or when a host's state change has held for a minute.
  The system text stays byte-identical, so Ollama answers from its prompt cache: first word in
  ~0.5 to 2 s instead of 6 to 8 s.
- Native Ollama API. Chat, explain, warm-up and prefill all call `/api/chat` with the same options
  (`AI_NUM_CTX` 8 192, `AI_TEMPERATURE` 0.7, `AI_TOP_P` 0.8, `keep_alive`), so the model is never
  reloaded with a different context size and really stays loaded for `AI_KEEP_ALIVE`.
- Prefill when the Assistant page opens; site focus block for questions that name a site.
- One request at a time: chat, explain and prefill share one slot; a request that waits more
  than 20 s gets `503 ai_busy` with `Retry-After`.

## Zabbix stack settings (`Proto1/docker-compose.yml`)

| Setting | Why | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| `--innodb-redo-log-capacity=2G`, `--innodb-flush-log-at-trx-commit=2` | the 100 MiB redo log made MySQL checkpoint constantly | writes 1.50 → 0.39 MB/s in a 60 s sample |
| json-file logs, 50 MB × 5 | zabbix-server wrote ~200 MB in 48 h | not measured |
| `stop_grace_period` 60 s (server), 120 s (mysql) | let the server flush trends on shutdown | "syncing trend data done" on restart |
| `ZBX_STARTPINGERS=3` | one pinger was 100 % busy, fping hit its 600 s limit | pinger busy 100 % → 74 % |
| `ZBX_LOGSLOWQUERIES=3000` | slow queries were never logged | not measured |
| `ZBX_MEMORYLIMIT=512M` (web) | `trend.get` exhausted PHP's 128 M | 0 memory errors after a 365-day report |
