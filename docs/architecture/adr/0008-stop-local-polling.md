# Stop local polling, and put `zabbix-server` behind a compose profile

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: HCML internship project
* Date: 2026-09-17, amended 2026-09-22

## Context and Problem Statement

To develop against realistic data, HCML's production Zabbix database was restored onto a laptop on
15 September. The restored stack includes `zabbix-server`, and a Zabbix server does not just serve
data, **it polls**. From 15 to 17 September this laptop was polling 95 of HCML's real production
devices over the corporate network, in parallel with HCML's own Zabbix doing the same.

## Decision Drivers

* A development laptop must not be a second monitoring system aimed at production equipment.
* The restored data must not be deleted by housekeeping.
* No alert may reach a real HCML recipient from a development copy.
* The safe configuration must be the **default**, not something remembered.

## Considered Options

* **Keep polling**, so the data stays current.
* **Stop `zabbix-server`**, keeping MySQL and the frontend on the stored data.
* **Delete the restored data** entirely.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen: **stop `zabbix-server`, keep the data.** Stopped 17 September at 16:59:37, cleanly, it
flushed its trends and exited 0.

**Amended 22 September**, after finding that the safe path was one forgotten flag away from the unsafe
one. `zabbix-web` declared `depends_on: zabbix-server`, so `docker compose up -d`, or even
`up -d zabbix-web`, **started the poller**. The documented safe form was `--no-deps mysql zabbix-web`,
i.e. the non-default.

That is now inverted. `zabbix-server` sits behind `profiles: ["poller"]`, so a plain
`docker compose up -d` brings up MySQL and the frontend only, and polling requires
`docker compose --profile poller up -d`. Verified: `docker compose config --services` returns
`mysql` and `zabbix-web` and nothing else.

### Positive Consequences

* **HCML's production devices are no longer polled from this laptop.** Settles audit item BE-24.
* Housekeeping cannot run, because housekeeping is a `zabbix-server` function. The 2.22 years of
  restored trends are safe from the `hk_trends='365d'` policy that is **armed in the data**.
* No alert can be sent, for the same reason: alerting is also `zabbix-server`'s job. Three
  independent layers now: no server process, all 7 actions disabled, all 43 media types disabled.
* MySQL write volume fell to **0 MB in a 60-second sample**, from 1.50 MB/s before tuning.
* The dataset is frozen, which makes every benchmark repeatable: [ADR-0007](0007-keep-the-zabbix-api.md)
  depends on that.
* The dangerous action is now explicit and named. `--profile poller` is hard to type by accident.

### Negative Consequences

* **The data is frozen at 17 September 16:59:37 and will never advance.** Every figure the portal
  shows is a snapshot of that moment. Anyone demoing it has to say so.
* Ping-based host states show as stale roughly ten minutes after any restart, which looks like a bug
  and is not.
* A fresh restore of `myown/zabbix_backup.sql` is **armed**: the dump carries actions 3, 7 and 9 at
  `status=0`, meaning *enabled*, including "Send Alert to Power Automate". The disabled state lives
  only inside the restored volume. **Anyone restoring that dump must disable actions and media types
  before `zabbix-server` ever touches it.**
* The compose file is now the only place this decision is encoded, and `Proto1` is not a git
  repository, so the profile change has no history behind it.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Keep polling

* Good, because the data stays live and demos show real current state.
* Bad, because a laptop is polling production equipment with no mandate, no change control, and no
  one expecting the traffic.
* Bad, because the restored history would be deleted by housekeeping within the hour unless suppressed.

### Stop the server, keep the data

* Good, because the whole estate's stored history stays usable for development.
* Bad, because the data is a fixed snapshot from then on.

### Delete the restored data

* Good, because it removes a copy of production data from a laptop.
* Bad, because it destroys the only dataset that makes the derived SLA verifiable against HCML's
  published reports, and that validation is the project's strongest correctness claim.

## Links

* Enables [ADR-0007](0007-keep-the-zabbix-api.md), which needs a frozen dataset to measure against
* `myown/log/17-9-26-zabbix-stack.md` §5.3: the original decision
* `myown/log/22-9-26.md`: the `depends_on` finding and the profile change
* `Proto1/docker-compose.yml`: the `poller` profile
