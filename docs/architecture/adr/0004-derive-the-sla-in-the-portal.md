# Compute the monthly SLA in the portal instead of using Zabbix Services and SLA

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: HCML internship project
* Date: 2026-09-15 (recorded as an ADR 2026-09-22, with the confirming measurement)

## Context and Problem Statement

HCML publishes a monthly Availability Report per device. Zabbix 7.0 ships a Services tree and an SLA
engine that exist to answer exactly this. Should the portal use them, or measure availability itself?

## Decision Drivers

* The answer must reproduce HCML's published figures, or nobody will trust the page.
* Whatever is chosen must work against HCML's Zabbix **as it is actually configured**.
* The portal is forbidden from writing configuration into production Zabbix.

## Considered Options

* **Use Zabbix's native Services + SLA** (`service.get`, `sla.get`, `sla.getsli`).
* **Configure Services in Zabbix first**, then use the native engine.
* **Replay trigger events in the portal** and compute availability there.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen: **replay the events in the portal.**

The deciding fact is not an opinion about which engine is better. It is that **there is nothing in
Zabbix's to use.** Measured directly against the production copy on 22 September 2026:

| Table | Rows |
|---|---|
| `services` | **0** |
| `services_links`, `service_problem`, `service_alarms`, `service_tag` | **0** |
| `sla` | **1**, `SLA:1`, weekly, SLO 99, no service tags, no schedule, nothing attached |

Zabbix's SLA engine has nothing to measure. `sla.getsli` against it returns an empty result, which is
why `/api/sla/source` exists at all: it reports `real: false` and the UI switches to the derived view.

The engine replays trigger PROBLEM/OK events into intervals, clips them to the window, merges
overlaps so two simultaneous problems are not counted twice, and aggregates by host, site, category
and class. Two profiles: `hcml-report` reproduces HCML's method, `availability` is the stricter figure
that also requires evidence the data was actually collected.

### Positive Consequences

* **It is validated to the digit** against HCML's own xlsx reports by
  `server/scripts/validate-sli.ts`: 2026-06 **99.3796 %**, 2026-07 **99.7167 %**, 2026-08
  **99.2313 %**; 138 of 138 hosts within 60 seconds of downtime; incident counts 739/739, 1165/1165,
  1417/1417. That is the strongest correctness claim anywhere in the project.
* **The method is inspectable.** `basis` in every response states which triggers count and how gaps
  and no-data are treated, so two profiles can be compared honestly instead of argued about.
* It requires **no write into production Zabbix**, which the portal is not permitted to make.
* It works today, against the estate as configured, with nobody configuring anything first.

### Negative Consequences

* **It is a reimplementation of something Zabbix ships**, and it has to stay correct as Zabbix's own
  semantics evolve.
* **It is the second most expensive thing the portal does.** The strict profile costs ~20 Zabbix calls
  and pulls up to ~103,000 trend rows for one month, and about 97 % of those rows exist only to
  answer one boolean per item-hour, "did this hour collect data?".
* Its `stats.zabbixCalls` counter **under-reports**: sliced `event.get` recursion is counted once, so
  the true call count is higher whenever a window exceeds 5,000 events.
* If HCML ever configures Services properly, this becomes duplication and should be revisited.
* A closed month's figure is immutable but is still recomputed after every restart. See
  [ADR-0003](0003-no-database.md).

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Use Zabbix's native Services + SLA

* Good, because it would be Zabbix's own answer, maintained by Zabbix.
* Bad, because at HCML it returns nothing. Zero services.
* Bad, because **it is not the cheap lookup it appears to be**: no table stores an SLI. `sla.getsli`
  replays `service_alarms` on every call, so it moves the same replay into PHP rather than reading a
  stored value.

### Configure Services in Zabbix first

* Good, because it would make the native engine usable and benefit every Zabbix consumer, not just
  the portal.
* Bad, because it means creating ~139 services and SLAs **by writing configuration into HCML's
  production Zabbix**: which this project is explicitly not allowed to do.
* **Worth revisiting** if HCML's own team wants it. It is the better long-term answer; it is simply
  not the portal's to make.

### Replay events in the portal

* Good, because it is verifiable against a published external figure.
* Bad, because it is a reimplementation with a real maintenance cost.
