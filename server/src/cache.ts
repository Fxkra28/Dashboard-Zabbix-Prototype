/**
 * In-memory TTL cache. Every Zabbix call hits its server + DB, so we cache
 * aggressively with short TTLs. Swap for Redis when scaling (setup.md §9).
 *
 * Coalesces concurrent misses: while one fetch is in flight for a key, other
 * callers await the same promise instead of stampeding Zabbix.
 *
 * Bounded to MAX_ENTRIES keys and to about MAX_BYTES of values, least recently
 * used evicted first. Keys that carry parameters (`graph:<items>:<from>:<to>`,
 * `explain:problem:<id>`) would otherwise accumulate for as long as the process runs.
 * The size of a value is an estimate (approxBytes).
 *
 * Two opt-in ways to answer with an expired value, for slow reports whose
 * figures move slowly (the derived SLA, availability, capacity). Never for
 * anything that shows problem or acknowledgement state: an operator who has
 * just acknowledged must not be shown the list from before.
 *
 *   staleMs       for this long after the TTL, answer at once with the old
 *                 value and refresh it in the background: one refresh per
 *                 stale window. A refresh that fails leaves the old value in
 *                 place; the first request after the window fetches in the
 *                 foreground again.
 *   staleIfError  when that foreground fetch fails, answer with the last
 *                 value this cache still holds, however old, and log it. A
 *                 report from an hour ago beats an error page while Zabbix is
 *                 struggling. Values dropped by invalidate() are gone for
 *                 good, so a write is never undone this way. The request is
 *                 told (staleness.ts: X-Data-Stale, X-Data-Age-Seconds).
 *
 * One opt-in way to keep a value that costs seconds to rebuild:
 *
 *   pin           ordinary eviction takes every unpinned entry first, so a
 *                 flood of graph keys cannot push out a closed month's SLA
 *                 report. Pins share at most MAX_PINNED_BYTES; past that the
 *                 least recently used pinned entry goes too.
