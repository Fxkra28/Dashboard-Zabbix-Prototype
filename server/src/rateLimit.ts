 * Rate limiting, ahead of the auth guard: call it before setupAuth. The plugin's own hooks go on
 * each route and run after every root hook, so the guard's 401s and the CSRF check's 403s would
 * never be counted and a route with a limit of its own (sign-in) would lose this one. As a root
 * onRequest hook it counts every request first, with sign-in's per-account limit on top (auth.ts);
 * POST /api/auth/login is the target that matters, being otherwise an unthrottled password oracle.
 *
 * SSE and health are exempt: /api/stream holds one long-lived connection per NOC screen rather than
 * making repeated requests, and /api/health is polled deliberately by every page and by container
 * health checks. So is sign-out: a refused one would leave the cookie working behind a page showing
 * sign-in.
