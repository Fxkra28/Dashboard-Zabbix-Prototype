 * Live problems via SSE (setup.md §7).
 *
 * One ticker serves every connected screen. Every 5 s it reads the same cache entry as GET
 * /api/problems and sends a frame only when something a screen shows has changed: a problem opened,
 * resolved, acknowledged, suppressed or re-graded. A change in only a name or host goes out at most
 * every 30 s. A list that is identical to the last one sent is never sent again: the keep-alive
 * says the line and the data are still current. A frame carries only the fields the Dashboard reads
 * (frameJson), so no tags and no `opdata`.
 *
 * A timer per connection would serialise and send the whole list every 5 s whether or not anything
 * had changed: ~450 KB per screen per tick against HCML's Zabbix.
 *
 * Screens are counted: STREAM_MAX_CLIENTS in all and STREAM_MAX_PER_USER for one signed-in user
 * (one client address with auth off). A screen over either limit gets a 429, and a signed-in screen
 * is ended when its token expires, so the browser reconnects with the renewed cookie.
