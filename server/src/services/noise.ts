 * HCML Goal 4: *"the main issue is not the number of alarms, but the quality
 * of information needed to act."*
 *
 * Top 100 triggers already answers *how often* a trigger fired. That alone
 * can't separate noise from signal: forty firings that self-clear in 90
 * seconds are noise; forty that take an hour each are a real recurring fault.
 * Duration and acknowledgement are what tell them apart, so this report adds
 * both, and flags the triggers worth retuning.
