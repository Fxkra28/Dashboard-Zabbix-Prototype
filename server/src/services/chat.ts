 * already makes.
 *
 * The response is a `text/event-stream`, same framing as /api/stream, so the
 * answer appears as it is generated rather than after a long silence:
 *
 *   event: context: what the model was shown (counts, snapshot time)
 *   event: token:   one piece of the answer; concatenate in order
 *   event: done:    finished; `ms` is the model's wall time, `firstTokenMs`
 *                     the wait for its first token, and `text` the cleaned-up
 *                     answer the client should keep in place of the raw tokens
 *   event: error:   the model failed part-way (or was busy with another
 *                     question); the text so far is all there is
